- **Role-Based Access**: Different roles like officers and manufacturers with distinct panels and permissions.
- **Notifications**: Real-time email notifications powered by Nodemailer and Sendinblue for critical updates.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (customized styles for various panels and pages), Chart.js for data visualization
- **Security**: BCrypt for password hashing, JWT for session handling
- **Email**: Nodemailer with Sendinblue API integration
- **File Upload**: Multer for handling document uploads (e.g., order blueprints)
- **Environment Configuration**: dotenv for managing environment variables

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v22.9.0 or higher)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) instance (local or cloud)

   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment configurations as follows:

   ```env
   PORT=3000
   MONGO_URI=<Your MongoDB connection string>
   SENDINBLUE_API_KEY=<Your Sendinblue API key>
   ```

4. Start the application:
